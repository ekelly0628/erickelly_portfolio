                    <h2>My Background</h2>
                </header>
                    <h3>Humble Beginnings</h3>
                    <p>I was born and raised on the Eastern Shore of Maryland; A small town called Salisbury. Growing up, I was always interested in music, math, science and technology. After graduating high school in 2015, I attended West Virgninia University where I got to hone and develop these skills. It was here that got to work on my passions and pursue a college degree. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>The College Years</h3>
                    <p>During my time in college, I met many interesting people and made great connections. I eventually graduated with a B.A in Audio Technology in May of 2019. I then set my sights on a career in the AV Tech industry as an Engineer while continuing my education. After graduation, I moved to the Washington, DC Metro Area to pursue my career. I was recruited to a small AV Technology Company that hosted coperate and private events. I gained a lot of experience and traction in the field while I was there. Unfornately, it all came to a halt on March 11th, 2020.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>COVID-19</h3>
                    <p>The pandemic foverever changed the world. Businesses, industries, relationships, and families across the global would never be the same. I was no exception. The pandemic forced everyone into their homes for 2 long years. Slowly, things started to improve. After a 6-month search for anything I could find, I was hired as a bartender at <a href="https://www.topgolf.com">Top Golf</a> in Germantown, MD. Thankfully, because this location is partially outside and spacious, it was allowed to reopen much earlier than most other businesses. While I was grateful for the opprotunity, it forced my career into a 2-year long side-quest.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>A New Beginning</h3>
                    <p>October 2022. It took a while to get back on track toward the AV tech industry. When I finally landed another AV Tech opprotunity, I hit the ground running. Since leaving TopGolf in 2022, I have held many tech and IT related roles, and I slowly started to realize that I was not hppay in this field. Additionally, due to my living situation, bouncing from job to job every year become exhausting and unfulfilling. Recently, I decided Software Development would be the career I can put down roots and grow in.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>A new Career Path</h3>
                    <p>In February of 2023, I made to chioce to choose a new career path. One where I could build and grow in. Since this decision, I have been on a new career trajectory. I was skeptical and a little nervous, but I would rather try and fail than spend my life wondering what if. I am looking forward to being a part of this industry and I can't wait to see what the future holds.</p>
